## Overview

The task was to create a Fullstack Manufacturer website.

### The challenges and tasks

- The challenge was to build a complete website from scratch including design.
- This was a really challenging task and there are a lot of features I can add and I will work on this.
- This project includes everything I learned till now.

### How it works

- The task is to build a website for a manufacturing company. I created both the user and admin areas of the website and also the areas where any user can visit.
- Users can browse the whole website and order from the saws that are added to the website. A user must order at least a minimum quantity otherwise he will not be able to place the order.
- The user has an area called a dashboard where he can check all the products he ordered and if he wants he can cancel the order that he did not pay. But once he completes the payment, he can not cancel.
- An area in the dashboard named, Add a review where a user can add his experience with Sawland.
- Also he can check his profile and update where necessary.
- He also can pay for the product using a debit/Visa/ master card.
  -Admin cannot place an order but he can add a new saw or manage the tools.
- He can see all the users that have been signed up. He can delete the user or make the user admin provide authorization.
- He also can see the products that are ordered. If a user makes the payment he can confirm this.
- Update profile is also available for admin.
- A normal user can browse the website without having an account but if he wants to place an order then he must sign up.

- I have learned to deploy a server to Heroku, Working with Mongoose. Creating my own REST API.
